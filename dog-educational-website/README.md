### Additional PROJECT DOCUMENTATION

## ✅ Design Considerations

- **Responsive Design**: Use Flexbox and Media Queries
- **Semantic HTML**: Use `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc.
- **Accessibility**: Add `alt` text to all images, good contrast colors
- **Code Structure**: Keep HTML clean, modular CSS, and JS for logic
- **Performance**: Use optimized images (compressed formats like `.webp`)
- **Consistency**: Stick with 2–3 fonts, and a calm color palette (maybe earthy or natural tones for a dog theme)
